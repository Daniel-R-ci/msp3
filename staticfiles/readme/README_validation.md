# Milestone Project 3 : The ShutterClickers Photo Club

## Full validation report

### HTML Validation

For all views, the generated HTML-code has been copied from the browsers "View source" function and pasted into the "Validate by direct input form" on [W3C Markup Valiadtion Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

**Home view**

Warnings and errors found and corrected:
- A couple of missing end tags
- Three warnings where sections didn't have headlines (Warning: Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections, or else use a div element instead for any cases where no heading is needed.) The suggested switch to divs were made. This was for areas holding Hero image and headline, login status and buttons, and viewing django message view ยง
- Use of "width: 100%" for static gallery image, changed to style="width: 100%"

After these changes, the html validated without errors or warnings

ยง This applied to the base.html template, and would therefore show up in all other validations if not already corrected here

**Albums view**

Only one warning was given for this view, and has been left without being corrected

![Validation of albums view](validation_albums.png)

Frankly, this has been left because I (Daniel) does not understand why it is shown here and not in the home view when they have a similar placement. Since it is a warning, it has been left and placed in project backlog to be reviewed in more detail if project is taken up again.

**Album view**

These errors and warnings were given on the first validation, and has been left without being corrected for now
![Validation of album view](validation_album.png)
- The errors referring to several elements having the same id comes from having two forms generated by Django in the same view, and both have the field description. In regards to functionality, it doesn't cause a problem. The same forms are not visible at the same time, and the Javascripts associated with the page doesn't access these items. Solutions considered or tried:
    - Searches has been made to find a way to change the id of items genererated with the Django forms but so far no solution has been found. 
    - Use different views so two forms are not generated at the same time. This was ruled out since it would lead to a lesser user experience wating for another server reload instead of dynamically bringing the correct element to view.
    - Change the name of fields in the model. This was ruled out since it requires more knowledge of models and database handling that has been covered so far in the cause, alternatively deleting models and database and start adding all contect from scratch
- The warning about elements as also shown in albums view has been left with the same reasoning

Further examinations of these errors and warnings has been placed in backlog, should the project be continued after submission.

**Photo view**

Errors and warnings handled after validation:

- Two errors ***Error: The aria-labelledby attribute must point to an element in the same document*** were handled. This came from changing names on the two Bootstrap modals in the document without changling these attributes.
- One warning about one section element not having a headline. A h2-headline with contect Comments was added before the comment form and list which solved the warning and also added a better user interface

This has been left and placed in backlog, for reasons discussed above.

**About view**

![Validation of about view](validation_about.png)  
These two warnings have been placed in backlog, for reasons discussed above.

### CSS Validation

The css file styles.css was tested in [W3C CSS validation service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
One instance was found where a rule only had "360x" instead of "360px". After correcting that, the validator approved the document without errors, but with five warnings. 
- One warning comes from not validating imported styling, this relates to the use of Google Fonts.
- The remaing warnings relates to the use of not being able to check CSS variables, due to their dynamic nature.
These warnings can not be worked around with the methods used and have been left without placing them in backlog.

(For some reasons, CSS Validator uses a mix of English and Swedish due to my language settings.)

### Javascript validation

The three Javascript-files albums.js, album.js and photo.js where all tested in JSHint, as deployed on [https://daniel-r-ci.github.io/jshint/](https://daniel-r-ci.github.io/jshint/) after previous Code Institute Code Along lessons. They were tested with option **ES6** enabled.

All files had some missing semicolons that didn't affect functionality. After correcting those, two errors errors of the type ***Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics. (document)*** remained in photo.js
![2 JS Errors](validation_js_errors.png)  

Accessing outer variables like this isn't an unusal case, and enabling the function **Relaxed** approves the code without errors.
